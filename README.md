# ImpulseResponses

Simple F# console app to convert WIR files (e.g. found [here](https://www.waves.com/downloads/ir-convolution-reverb-library) into a WAV format, compatible with standard convolution reverb VST plugins.

Edit the input/output directories in Program.fs and run from the command line using ```dotnet run```.
